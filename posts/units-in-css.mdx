## Units in CSS

As we know, there are multiple units in CSS which we can use, but the question is when to use the them and
what you can do with different units and how they can solve common problems faced while building a responsive
and accessible UI for your webapp or website.

In this blog I am going to talk about the importance of different CSS units.
. So without further-a-do, Let's start. Also this blog is a takeaway from <LinkComponent type="external" text=" Josh W Comeau's " href="https://joshwcomeau.com?ref=badcode" />

### Pixels

The most common unit related with size in CSS is **pixels**.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  margin-bottom: 12px;
  padding: 12px;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

Pixel is the most used unit in CSS when it comes to size. This is more or less what you see
on the screen and it is easy to understand. Most of the usecases of size can be solved by this
and will work fine.

### EMs

The `em` unit is a relative unit, equal to the font size of the **current** element.

If a heading has a font-size of 12px, and we give it a padding of `2em`,
we can expect that the element will have 24px of padding around it (2 * 12px).

You can use the code editor below and try changing the font-size of the `.text` in `style.css`
and see how it works.

<CodePen
  codePenId="ExXJOzQ"
  editable={true}
  tabs={["css", "result"]}
/>

** How often I use ems? ** I never use them. It is very chaotic to use them in your
application because they are relative to the current elements font size. And if I decide
to change my font-size by 2px the other properties which use `em` will get affected and then
have to change the value of `em` to get them set again. So an extra work is required which i
don't want to do.

### REMs

The `rem` unit is also a relative unit, but it is different from `em` in that it is relative to the
font-size of the root element, the `html` tag.

All of the rems in your app will be relative to the `html` tag. By default the `html` tag has a font-size of 16px.
So 1rem will be equal to 16px.

Here i have given an example for you to play with so you can understand how rem works.
**Try changing the font-size of the html element**

<CodePen
  editable={true}
  codePenId="QWgPJoN"
  tabs={["css", "result"]}
/>

See how the text scales accordingly, when the font-size of the `html` tag is changed.
That's why the people like the rem unit. No matter where the an element is in the DOM tree,
the rem is consistent.

Also Please don't change the font-size of the `html` tag. This will override the users default font
size selected in their browser. We are using it here to demonstrate how rem works.

So how this makes our app accessible. So if a person has poor vision, they may wish to increase
the font size.

So there are two ways by which the user can do that.

1. By changing the browser zoom using `Ctrl + ` or `Cmd +`. This scales everything in your app and is
akin to changing the display resolution.

2. They can set the default font-size to larger font-size in their browser settings, for e.g. to
20px and 24px.

The first option — zooming in and out — will work regardless of which units you use;
it scales everything according to a ratio, so if you want the site to be 20% bigger,
that will always work.

The second option only works with em or rem units, since it works by changing the
default font size of the page.

On the one hand, we can breathe a little easier knowing that users can always increment
font size if they wish. But we can't shrug off this concern entirely; zooming in and out
is a pain. Every website has a different font size, which means users constantly need to
fiddle with the zoom level. If we respected their default font size, they wouldn't have
to make tweaks on a per-site basis.

### Matter of fact

So all these units have their own benefits and disadvantages. Here is how I would use them.

- For typography, I would use `rem` because it has accessibility benefits.

- For spacing, I would use `px` because it's more intuitive than rem, and there isn't a
clear accessibility win.

- For width and height, I will use either `px` or `%` depending upon whether I need a fix size or
a relative size
