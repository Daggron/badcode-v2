  A state is a data container that contains the data for a component throughout
  its lifecycle. A state can contain any data and can be used anywhere in the component.‌
  React does a great job with the state and every time the state is changed in react
  it performs a rerender of the component to update the value of the state throughout
  the component. However these updates are asynchronous and a state update will be done after
  the function which is updating the state is executed.‌ For e.g

  ```js
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  ```
  <p className="my-8">
    So here in this example, the initial value of the counter is 0.&nbsp;
    <strong>Please note,</strong> the counter here is a state variable.
  </p>

  ‌So if I try to update the state here like this

```js
counter = 1
```

  it will be updated but not communicated to the component that the state is updated
  and you need to recalculate all your logic which you are managing with this state.
  So how to update the state correctly.
  Well, the answer is simple.
  By using the <span className="font-medium text-phrase">setCounter</span> function.‌

  So if I do it like this

  ```js
    setCounter(1)‌
  ```

  Then react will re-render the component and all the logic which is
  dependent upon the counter variable will be recalculated and the value for the state
  is updated at all respective places.‌

  So React state updates are async, but what does that mean‌?
  So let me give you a quick example of this, try doing this in your code

  ```js
    function foo() {
      setCounter(5);
      console.log(counter);
    }‌
  ```

  as the previous value of count was 0 and if you execute this function
  the value of counter printed in the function will be 0 and not 5.
  So why did this happen? The reason is simple because the updates are async and
  moreover react will execute the function
  <span className="font-medium text-phrase">setCounter </span>
  after the foo is executed. So why does react do it this way instead of updating
  the state first and then performing other tasks?

  It's like this because of performance suppose you have done this setState multiple
  times in the function and then react has to re-render the component each time the state
  is updated within the function which costs performance. So that's why react executes
  all the setState functions after the parent function is executed which means all the
  state updates are async and batched in nature.

  So this means that the react state updates will be triggered after the function has
  finished its execution and then react will execute all the setState function in the
  parent function and one by one and after all functions done execution react will cause
  a re-render to update the state value related with the respective setState function‌

<div className="mb-4" />
<H4 className="mb-4" text="Batched Updates, huh …" />

  So it is clear that if you do multiple setState in a function
  they will be batched and will be executed one by one. So this creates some bug/problem in the code
  like say we want to do something like this


```js
// Let us suppose the initial value of counter is 0
function foo() {
  setCounter(counter + 1)
  setCounter(counter + 2)
  setCounter(counter + 3)
}‌
```

  So if you look at this code we are updating the counter thrice and the expected result should be 6.
  But if you check the output of this code the result will be 3.

  Can you guess the reason …

  ‌Yes, you get it right it's because of the async batched updates of react.‌

  So what react has done here is it took all the setCounter function and executed them one by one but
  while executing react didn't trigger a re-render to update the value of the counter in the component so
  the counter's value remains 0 for all the 3 setCounter functions and the end result was 3. We discussed earlier
  why react don't re-render the component on each state update when there are multiple state updates happening
  inside a function it's because of performance.‌

  So this introduced a bug in the code how to solve it.‌

  So there can be multiple ways to solve this but there is one way which react provides to solve it in the
  best react way possible.‌

  So React is smart and it knows its pitfall of batching the state updates. So react comes up with a callback
  function in setState so that the setState has access to the previous state of the component and bugs like these
  don't occur in the codebase and keeping the code the same and maintain the performance.‌

  So here is the solution for this

```js
function foo() {
  setCounter((prevState) => prevState + 1);
  setCounter((prevState) => prevState + 2);
  setCounter((prevState) => prevState + 3);
}
// Now the value of the counter will be 6 as expected‌
```

  So react takes a callback function in setState and pass the previous state of the component as a param to provide
  access to the latest value of the previous state so that the updates which depend upon the previous state values can
  be performed efficiently.‌

<div className="mb-4" />
<H4 className="mb-4" text="But are all state updates batched?‌" />

  The answer is no.
  Only state updates inside a <span className="text-phrase">Synthetic event </span>
  and <span className="text-prase">React lifecycle methods</span> are batched.
  The reason is simple because for normal js functions react has no idea when they
  are triggered and when the execution is complete so it doesn't know how many states updates
  are triggered from it. A cool example of this will be‌ <span className="text-phrase">setState </span>
  inside <span className="text-prase">setTimeOut</span> and <span className="text-phrase">Promises. All </span>.
  State updates inside promises and js inbuilt functions will be non-batched and cause a re-render every time the state
  is updated inside them.‌

<div className="mb-4" />
<H4 className="mb-4" text="What does this mean??" />

  So if you run the above code then React will cause 2 re-renders of component one for updating the name and
  one for updating loading status and these updates won't be batched. But they still will be async.‌

  So this will cause a problem for as it has caused for me. So what we were trying to do is making an api call
  to  one of our services at <LinkComponent type="external" text="smallcase" href="https://smallcase.com" /> and
  based on the data provided by that service we were trying to show some data to user.

  But it caused some bugs in our code the code was written like this

```js
  fetch('// ...some service url')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    setIsLoading(false);
    setData(data);
    setErrors(false);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // ... Log error to error logging service
    setIsLoading(false);
    setErrors(false);
  })
```

and when were trying to read the data in our component was like this

```jsx
  function OurComponent() {
    if (isLoading) {
      return <LoaderComponent />
    }
    if (!isLoading) {
      return <ChildComponent href={data.href} {...restOfData} />
    }
  }
```

  and this caused our app to break. This was because the loading state was set to false
  and it caused a re-render and since the data was not set by the <span className="text-phrase">setData </span>
  function so there was no data and were trying to get the some properties out of it.

  So what most of the new devs could have done here is they could have written the code like this

  ```js
    fetch('...some service url')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      setData(data);
      setErrors(false);
      setIsLoading(false);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      // ... Log error to error logging service
      setErrors(false);
      setIsLoading(false);
    });
  ```
  This at the top looks like it has solved the problem but it's not the best way to do it. Again this will
  still have 3 re-renders of the component.‌ And it is possible that someone may come and he updates the function
  and put back <span className="text-phrase">setLoading</span> to top and then it will again crash your app.

  So what we did was we used <LinkComponent type="external" text="useReducer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer/?ref=badcode.dev" />
  as these states were interlinked and need to be updated at same time so this was a use case for <strong>useReducer</strong>.
  So we wrote a reducer like this

  ```js
  function myCustomReducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'loading':
        return {
          ...state,
          isLoading: true,
        }
      case 'success':
        return {
          ...state,
          isLoading: false,
          data: action.data,
          hasError: false,
        }
      case 'error':
        return {
          ...state,
          isLoading: false,
          hasError: true,
        }
    }
  }
  ```

  and used it to update our state based on the response of the api call.

  ```js
   
    fetch('// ...some service url')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      dispatch({type: 'sucess', data: data});
    })
    .catch(err => {
      // ... Log error to error logging service
      dispatch({type: 'error'});
    });
  ```
  And now the code is much cleaner and we have a single reducer and it updates the state based on the response of the api call.
  and no more multiple re-renders, and no more bugs.‌ And anyone can come and may change the order inside reducer and
  it will still work.‌
