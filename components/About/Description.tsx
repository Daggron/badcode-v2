    <p>
      I am a Software Developer by profession and by my own pure ðŸ’– for it. I
      believe that knowledge is power, and to keep that power with me, I like to
      explore new things and study about how the industry is growing and how big
      players are using the technology to provide the best in class experience
      to customers like you and me. Also I consider OSS to be a very important
      part of anyone who is in this industry, be it a student who is currently
      learning things or a tech giant.
